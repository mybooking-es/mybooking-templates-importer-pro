== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I import via the WP-CLI? =

You can use the following WP-CLI commands:

* `wp mybooking-templates-importer list` - Which will list any predefined demo imports currently active theme might have,
* `wp mybooking-templates-importer import` - which has a few options that you can use to import the things you want (content/widgets/customizer/predefined demos). Let's look at these options below.

`wp mybooking-templates-importer import` options:

`wp mybooking-templates-importer import [--content=<file>] [--widgets=<file>] [--customizer=<file>] [--predefined=<index>]`

* `--content=<file>` - will run the content import with the WP import file specified in the `<file>` parameter,
* `--widgets=<file>` - will run the widgets import with the widgets import file specified in the `<file>` parameter,
* `--customizer=<file>` - will run the customizer settings import with the customizer import file specified in the `<file>` parameter,
* `--predefined=<index>` - will run the theme predefined import with the index of the predefined import in the `<index>` parameter (you can use the `wp mybooking-templates-importer list` command to check which index is used for each predefined demo import)

The content, widgets and customizer options can be mixed and used at the same time. If the `predefined` option is set, then it will ignore all other options and import the predefined demo data.
